console.log(`data types numbers`);

/* to find out the type of data you are working with:
   on the console type typeof followed by the variable name or any other value */

// example:
const age = 100;
// typeof age would return "number"
const name = 'Paulo';
// typeof name would return "string"

// typeof 100 would also return "number"
// typeof 'Paulo' would also return "string"

// a number can be an integer which means a number without decimals
const age1 = 200;

// a number can also be a float which means a number with decimals
const measure = 2.5;

/* 
with number you can use:
multiplication: *
substraction:   -
division:       /
addition:       +
modulo:         % 
*/
